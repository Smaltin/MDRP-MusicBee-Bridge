# MDRP-MusicBee-Bridge
This repo works on developing a connection between [MDRP](https://github.com/jojo2357/Music-Discord-Rich-Presence) starting with MDRP version 1.6.0. Video tutorial: https://youtu.be/GucN2WiteOM

## Installation
There are no special instructions for installation. Add the DLL to the plugins folder, or go through the mb api

## Configuration
There are some settings that you may like to configure to improve your MDRP experience.

### Close MDRP on MB close
This is especially recommended if you only use MB. When checked, MDRP will close when you close MDRP.
### Automatically Run MDRP
When ticked, MB will attempt to open MDRP if contact cannot be made at MB startup. This relies on `MDRP Location` to have a valid location.
### MDRP Location
Insert the location of `MDRP.exe`. The location is valid when a green check mark appears next to the text box. 

**NOTE: ONLY MDRP.exe will be accepted as every version prior to 1.6.0 went by a different name. Make sure you have at least version 1.6.0 of MDRP running before using this plugin.**
### Image Pack
If you added the MDRP bridge panel onto your panel layout, this will change the images that represent the states of mdrp.
